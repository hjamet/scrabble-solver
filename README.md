# Scrabble AI Solver

An ultra-high-performance Scrabble solver designed to always win. This project combines a high-performance C engine with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms and a modern web interface for testing and gameplay.

## Project Overview

This is a side project focused on creating the most powerful Scrabble solver possible. The goal is to build a system that can consistently defeat human players by leveraging:

- **High-performance C engine** for position evaluation and move generation
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for strategic decision making
- **Modern web interface** for testing, visualization, and online gameplay
- **Multi-language support** for international Scrabble variants

## Architecture

The project is structured as a multi-component system:

```
scrabble-solver/
├── engine/           # C-based core engine (position evaluation, move generation)
├── mcts/            # C-based Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation
├── web-interface/   # Node.js web application for testing and gameplay
├── dictionaries/    # Word lists and dictionaries for multiple languages
├── tests/           # Comprehensive test suite
└── docs/            # Documentation and analysis
```

### Core Components

- **`engine/`**: High-performance C library for:
  - Board state representation and manipulation
  - Move generation and validation
  - Score calculation with bonus tiles
  - Position evaluation and ranking
  - Dictionary lookup optimization

- **`mcts/`**: Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation in C for:
  - Strategic move selection
  - Long-term planning
  - Opponent modeling
  - Endgame optimization

- **`web-interface/`**: Node.js application inspired by [scrabble-solver](https://github.com/kamilmielnik/scrabble-solver) for:
  - Interactive board visualization
  - Move testing and validation
  - Performance monitoring
  - Online multiplayer support
  - Real-time analysis display

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C compiler (GCC 9+ or Clang 10+)
- Node.js 18+
- CMake 3.16+
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scrabble-solver.git
cd scrabble-solver

# Build the C engine
cd engine
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# Install web interface dependencies
cd ../../web-interface
npm install

# Download dictionaries
npm run download-dictionaries
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the web interface
cd web-interface
npm start

# The application will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Language**: All code written in English
- **C Code**: Follow GNU coding standards
- **JavaScript**: Use ESLint and Prettier
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation

### Testing
- Unit tests for all core functions
- Integration tests for engine components
- Performance benchmarks
- End-to-end testing for web interface

### Performance Optimization
- Profile-guided optimization for C code
- SIMD instructions where applicable
- Memory pool allocation
- Cache-friendly data structures

## Contributing

This project is managed by Nicolas and the repository owner. Contributions are welcome for:

- Performance optimizations
- Additional language support
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Documentation enhancements

### Development Workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement changes with tests
4. Submit a pull request

## Inspiration

The web interface draws inspiration from [kamilmielnik/scrabble-solver](https://github.com/kamilmielnik/scrabble-solver), which provides an excellent foundation for Scrabble visualization and interaction. However, our implementation uses a custom high-performance C engine rather than JavaScript-based solving.
