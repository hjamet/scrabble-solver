# Development Environment Rules

## Installation Script

The project uses a single, clean installation script: [install-dev-env.ps1](mdc:install-dev-env.ps1)

### Usage
```powershell
# Run as administrator
.\install-dev-env.ps1
```

### What it does
1. Downloads and installs MSYS2 automatically
2. Creates `install-tools.sh` for MSYS2 package installation
3. Adds MSYS2 to system PATH
4. Provides clear instructions for next steps

## Environment Requirements

### Windows Development
- **MSYS2 UCRT64**: Primary development environment
- **GCC**: C/C++ compiler
- **CMake**: Build system
- **Make**: Build automation
- **GDB**: Debugger

### Installation Process
1. Run `install-dev-env.ps1` as administrator
2. Launch MSYS2 UCRT64 from Start Menu
3. Navigate to project directory
4. Run `./install-tools.sh` in MSYS2 terminal
5. Restart terminal/PowerShell
6. Verify with `gcc --version`

## File Management

### Generated Files
- `install-tools.sh`: Created by installation script, should be deleted after use
- `build/`: Build output directory, ignored by git
- Any `.exe`, `.o`, `.obj` files: Generated during compilation

### Temporary Files
- All temporary files must be deleted immediately after use
- No temporary files should be committed to git
- Use `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

## Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
- Remove `install-tools.sh` after successful installation
- Clean build directories regularly
- Remove any temporary test files
- Keep only essential project files

### Documentation Updates
- Update README.md when installation process changes
- Keep environment setup instructions current
- Remove obsolete documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Single responsibility**: Each script has one clear purpose
2. **Minimal dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary tools or files
3. **Clear instructions**: Provide step-by-step guidance
4. **Automatic cleanup**: Scripts should clean up after themselves
5. **Error handling**: Provide clear error messages and solutions
